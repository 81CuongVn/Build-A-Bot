# Build-A-Bot
The base repository for Top.gg's Build-A-Bot Event.

## Introduction
We'll be using discord.js simply because it's the best library to use when starting out as a developer or when learning to code a Discord bot thanks to its vast community and plethora of online resources to help you along the way! We'll also be basing all of the code in this tutorial on the [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide/) documentation so you may build upon it further using these docs as guidance in the future.

We'll be self-hosting this bot on our local machines for the purpose of this tutorial, but most of the process is essentially the same if you're using a VPS.

For more help we encourage you to use the **#development** channel in the [Top.gg Discord server](https://discord.com/dbl) where you can find help from other bot developers in our community!
